## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-03

Initial release of the MAOps Python DevOps Automation Toolkit. Establishes
the packaging, CLI, and diagnostics foundation for Project 2 of the MAOps
DevOps portfolio.

### Added

- `src`-layout package `maops_pydevops`, installable with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`,
  targeting Python 3.11+, with a CI matrix configured to validate 3.11,
  3.12, 3.13, and 3.14 on every push (locally exercised on 3.12 so far;
  see the CI workflow run history for actual multi-version results).
- Console script `maops-py`, with `python -m maops_pydevops` invoking the
  identical CLI through a single shared entry point.
- `maops-py doctor` — a read-only, network-free environment diagnostic
  command with `text` (default) and `json` output formats, covering
  supported Python version, package import, supported OS family,
  temporary-directory availability, filesystem encoding, and Python
  executable resolution as required checks, and git/docker/kubectl/
  terraform/ansible presence as optional (warn-only) checks.
- `maops-py version` / `maops-py --version` for toolkit version reporting,
  backed by a single authoritative version source in `pyproject.toml`.
- Exit-code convention: `0` success, `1` operational/required-check
  failure, `2` CLI usage error.
- Typed, immutable core models (`CheckStatus`, `OutputFormat`,
  `PythonInfo`, `PlatformInfo`, `DoctorCheck`, `DoctorReport`) with
  explicit serialization.
- Full local quality gate via `Makefile` (`format`, `lint`, `type-check`,
  `test`, `coverage`, `build`, `smoke-install`, `quality`,
  `release-check`).
- GitHub Actions workflow `Python Validation`, running `make
  release-check` across the full Python support matrix with pinned,
  read-only-permission Actions.
